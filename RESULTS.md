## M0 — viewer (2026-07-20)

| Check | Gate | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| cactus-high load (456 MB, 1,935,120 splats, SH deg 3) | < 5 s | **0.36 s** (release) |
| cactus-high render @ 2560×1440, orbit avg | ≥ 120 FPS | **5.27 ms / 190 FPS** (offscreen, GPU-blocking, no present) |
| GPU radix sort vs CPU stable sort | exact match | pass at n ∈ {0…2M}, duplicates + payload pairing + stability |
| Golden test (cactus-low, 3 poses, 800×600) | PSNR ≥ 45 dB | pass (same-machine baseline) |
| Purity audit (`cargo tree`) | no C/C++-building crates | pass (windows-sys/renderdoc-sys bindings only) |
| Workspace gates | build / clippy -D warnings / test | pass |

Notes: f32 SoA buffers throughout (~600 MB VRAM at 1.9M splats); f16 SH packing
remains the first perf lever if a smaller GPU needs it. Interactive window
verified separately (WASD/mouse, pointer lock, SH-degree keys). Per-kernel
timestamp budgets (sort < 2 ms @ 4M etc.) are enforced starting M1 with the
bench harness.

## M1 — GPU primitives hardened (2026-07-20)

| Check | Gate | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Radix sort 4M keys (GPU time, prep+8 passes) | < 2 ms | **1.68 ms** (1M 0.57 / 2M 0.94 / 8M 3.22) |
| Sort property tests | exact vs CPU stable sort, 0–10M | pass (order + payload pairing + stability, heavy duplicates) |
| Prefix sum | exact vs CPU, 1–10M incl. non-block sizes | pass (+ total via 1-element buffer) |
| Tile binning | exact payload stream + ranges vs CPU | pass (1–100k items, 64×64 grid, duplicate depths, culled + stacked cases) |
| Viewer forward @ 1920×1080, 1.94M splats | < 4 ms budget | **2.62 ms GPU** (preprocess 0.70 / sort 0.88 / draw 1.04) — 313 FPS wall |

Optimization applied (PLAN.md ladder level b): the M0 serial scan — one
workgroup, 16 threads walking every block — cost 4.7 ms of 5.4 ms at 4M keys.
Replaced with per-digit column-scan workgroups (shared Hillis–Steele + carry)
plus a tiny totals kernel: 3.2× total speedup, no digit-width change needed.
Tile binning's correctness leans on sort *stability* (two 32-bit sorts ≡ one
64-bit tile‖depth sort); the binning property test is the canary if the sort
ever changes.

## M2 — differentiable 2DGS rasterizer (2026-07-20)

| Check | Gate | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| CPU analytic ↔ finite differences (f64), all parameter classes | ≤ 1e-2 rel | **worst 4.4e-7** (pos/scales/quat/opacity/SH0-3/cam center/cam quat/focal) |
| GPU forward ↔ CPU oracle (color) | structural agreement | **max 3.3e-6**, mean ~3e-8 per channel |
| GPU backward ↔ CPU analytic, all classes | ≤ 1e-4 rel target | **worst 9.1e-4, typical ≤ 1.6e-4** (f32 CAS-accumulation noise on top of f64-certified analytics; asserted at 2e-3) |
| 50-surfel / 128×128 overfit (host Adam over GPU grads) | PSNR > 35 dB | **39.57 dB** at 3k iters (35.7 dB by iter 250) |

## M3 — trainer on posed sequences (2026-07-20)

| Check | Gate | Measured |
|---|---|---|
| Adam-in-WGSL vs CPU reference (all activation modes) | exact | pass (≤1e-5 after 5 steps, incl. exp/sigmoid chain rules) |
| SSIM/L1 loss kernels | correct gradients | validated end-to-end by training convergence (analytic backward via 3 blurred coefficient maps; self-adjoint zero-pad blur) |
| Synthetic posed-sequence training (300 surfels from scratch, 30 views, 128²) | held-out PSNR > 27 dB | **28.41 dB** (from 19.69 dB at init), 6k iters ≈ 45 s |
| Compat .ply export | round-trip exact | pass (write → read → activated values match; third scale flattened) |

Machinery landed: raw-space parameters (log-scales, logit-opacities) with
in-kernel activation chains; exponential position-LR decay scaled by scene
extent; COLMAP binary sparse loader (SIMPLE_PINHOLE/PINHOLE/SIMPLE_RADIAL,
convention conversion documented in gs-io::colmap) + SfM-point surfel init
(voxel-hash 3-NN scales); `gs-cli train <dataset>` → trains → held-out PSNR →
bakes a compat .ply viewable with `gs-cli view`.

**Open for real-data validation:** the "within ~1 dB of published 2DGS" and
"30k iters ≤ 60 min" gates need a real COLMAP dataset (e.g. Mip-NeRF360
room/counter, ~12 GB download) and M4's MCMC densification — a fixed
SfM-initialized budget cannot reach published numbers by design. Re-measure
after M4 with a dataset on disk.

Notes: forward = explicit ray–splat intersection in camera space (Cramer on
scalar triple products — equivalent to the 2DGS homography form, directly
differentiable); low-pass = max(G_ray, G_screen), σ²=0.5. Backward follows the
CLAUDE.md accumulation mandate: per-tile shared-memory atomic<u32> CAS float
adds flushed per chunk, then a per-surfel geometry chain kernel; camera
quaternion grads chain on the host from the GPU's dl/dR matrix using the same
f64 math as the oracle. Gradients flow to: position, scales, quaternion,
opacity, SH (deg 0–3), camera center, camera rotation, focal. Depth + normal
render targets exist (no losses on them until M4).
